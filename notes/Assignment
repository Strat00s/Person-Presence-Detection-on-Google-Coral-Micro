### Title
Camera-based presence detection on embedded devices

### Assignment
Design a solution for person presence detection in radiation monitor screens using a suitable development platform with a single-chip microcontroller and camera. The device is intended for continuous operation. The camera is in a fixed position relative to the radiation monitor, but the field of view also includes space outside the monitor. The proposed solution must be resistant to changes in ambient lighting, movement of people or materials outside the monitored device, and short-term shocks. The reaction time can be a maximum of a few seconds. The output is a status signal indicating whether a person is present or not in the detection area. A suitable method for configuring the device and the detection area within the camera's field of view must be included.
