### Front angle
##### 45˚
More testing
Hard to tell how close people are to the walls
Sees both sides, but one is hard to mask (because of the angle)
##### 90˚
Bad lighting
Can only see one side
Bad performence when seeing people from the back
    Better lighting might help

##### 30˚
Looks promising
Sees only one side
Back side mask heavily squed due to the angle
Detects from both side
    Back side still harder
Good enough illumination

### Front Side
angle does not really matter here, as the camera is too close in general
maybe moving it somewhat back would be better, but that does not seems to be possible/feasable
