### Front angle
##### 45˚
More testing
Hard to tell how close people are to the walls
Sees both sides, but one is hard to mask (because of the angle)
##### 90˚
Bad lighting
Can only see one side
Bad performence when seeing people from the back
    Better lighting might help

##### 30˚
Looks promising
Sees only one side
Back side mask heavily squed due to the angle
Detects from both side
    Back side still harder
Good enough illumination

### Front Side
angle does not really matter here, as the camera is too close in general
maybe moving it somewhat back would be better, but that does not seems to be possible/feasable

### Side center
##### Outside
Too close
##### Inside
Still really close, but custom model might help with that
Masks align well, but because subject is really close, unmasked part has to be really large
cannot tell how close to any side subject is


### Side top middle
Probably one of the best possitions
Detects both direction without problem
Problem are objects with long hair and same coloured

Angle seems to be good enough
Detectin much better if facing the camera

Probably the best option so far..
